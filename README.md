# DNS-Toggle

**DNS-Toggle** is a personal project designed specifically for **Android 15** (the current version I'm using). It provides a simple solution for toggling DNS settings, with **dns.adguard-dns.com** as the only supported server. I primarily use AdGuard DNS and, therefore, have not included other DNS servers.

The idea for this app arose from past issues I encountered with other DNS toggler apps. Even when those apps were set up as system apps, they were still frequently killed by the system. In contrast, **DNS-Toggle** works more reliably for me, without the delays I experienced with other solutions. This app serves as my personal fix for these issues.
